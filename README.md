# Simple Targets Tutorial

This is a very quick demo of using the [{targests}](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html) package.

In this, I have run the function `use_targets()` to generate the initial targets script, then edited it to use the
code that I have created for this demo.

You can run the pipeline using `tar_make()`.

Note that these are all dummy scripts that don't do anything particularly useful. In practice, you would want to create
a quarto document and actually render it, in this I just return a filename.
